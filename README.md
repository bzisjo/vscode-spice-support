# SPICE Language Support for VS Code

This package provides syntax highlighting for various flavors of SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis).

The snippets are a work in progress, and I plan to only add new ones as I come across them in my daily use. If you have ones you would like to see added, file an issue and I will try to accomodate. (Or better yet, add it yourself and file a pull request!)

- Syntax Highlighting (for reference, see [leoheck/sublime-spice](https://github.com/leoheck/sublime-spice))
